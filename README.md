## Information that my Tool's Updater Requires.

- The entire tool, including updater, was created in C#.
- The main tool is to be used for Black Ops 2 to make modded classes that are not usually possible by modifying certain hex values within the game.
- This is a very small tool but I felt that it needed an updater if I ever choose to add more class presets to it.

## If you use this tool please don't say you created it, give credit where it's due.
